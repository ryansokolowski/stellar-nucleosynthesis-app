# Stellar Nucleosynthesis Web App

## 🌌 Purpose
This Streamlit web app illustrates the process and limitations of stellar nucleosynthesis. It allows users to interactively explore how different variables affect the lifecycle and end-states of stars.

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Sliders**:
  - **r-process** and **p-process**: Adjust the contribution of rapid and proton capture processes.
  - **Solar Mass**: Explore how stellar mass influences collapse rate and final fate.
- **Dynamic Visualization**:
  - A pie chart displays the likelihood of different stellar end-states:
    - White Dwarf
    - Neutron Star
    - Supernova
    - Black Hole
